## What I learnt from this Project:

- Giving correct padding to buttons
- Displaying list elements on a same line using the property `display:inline-block`
- Removing the list styles
- Placing of each and every element of the page using `position`
- Usage of padding to provide gap to list elements

## Time taken:
 Took around 24 hours to complete this.
